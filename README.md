# TransBus
The TransBus System is a web-based transport management solution designed to streamline public transportation operations in urban settings. It integrates real-time tracking, route and checkpoint management, and user account functionalities for administrators, drivers, and passengers. Developed using Django, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQLite, and Leaflet, the system enables customers to view bus locations, calculate fares, make mock wallet payments (can be replaced with real payment gateways such as m-pesa), and submit complaints, while drivers manage route progress with automated checkpoint logging. Administrators can approve drivers, configure routes and fares, and monitor system-wide activity. By addressing inefficiencies in traditional transport systems, TransBus enhances transparency, operational oversight, and user experience in public transit.
